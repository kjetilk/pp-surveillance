## Personal Projects: Surveillance

This is a repository for some scripting around projects that I initiate and run.

Please contact me if any of this is of interest.

### Blacklight scanning of Norway's public sector

A script that takes as input a file consisting of main business entities in Norway. It extracts from that the websites of certain sectors. I ran this on the public sector. Then it looks up in [Blacklight](https://themarkup.org/blacklight) (you have to talk to them to use their API) and saves summaries in a SQL database.
